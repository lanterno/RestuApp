#RestuApp


### This app is all about building a Restful API and using a restaurant example to explain that on.
#### It's built on Django Rest Framework(DRF) and tries to implement all three stages of the
#### Richardson Maturity model https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html
#### including HATEOAS.

#### The technology stack is minimal, but will expand with time:
- django
- DRF
- Pytest
- Pycov
- PipFile
- sqlite3

#### I'm also following the unofficial project template suggested by cookiecutter
#### and following a TDD practice
